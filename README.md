# WebUntis on Apple Watch âŒš

*__Note:__ The main source is in `ios/ios/SitnuWatch-Watch Extension`*

This Client is based on my own [WebUntis Swift Framework](https://github.com/TheNoim/WebUntis-Swift). 

I will propably not publish this app on the app store, but if you want to use it, you could compile it your self and use it. 

## Features

- Complication Support with Lesson Countdown
- Background Refresh
- Apple Watch App
- Support for every school using WebUntis

## Bugs/Feature Requests

If you find any Bug with this App, write an Issue in this GitHub Repo. 

Make sure to give enough information. A simple: `It does not work` doesen't help anybody.

## Final note

I was too lazy to write the iOS Client in Swift, because it purposes is just to send the login credentials to the apple watch app. You will probably only use it once.
