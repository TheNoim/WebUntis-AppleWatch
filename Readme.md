# WebUntis on Apple Watch âŒš

This Client is based on my own [WebUntis Swift Framework](https://github.com/TheNoim/WebUntis-Swift). 

I will probably not publish this app on the app store, but if you want to use it, you can compile it your self and use it. 

## Features

- Complication Support with Lesson Countdown
- Background Refresh
- Apple Watch App
- Support for every school using WebUntis

## Bugs/Feature Requests

If you find any Bug with this App, write an Issue in this GitHub Repo. 

Make sure to give enough information. A simple: `It does not work` doesen't help anybody.
